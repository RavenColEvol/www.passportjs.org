# Google

[Google Identity](https://developers.google.com/identity) offers a suite of SDKs
and protocols that enables users to sign into app using their Google accounts
and authorize apps to use Google services.

The SDKs that Google offers support a range of platforms, including the web,
Android, and iOS.  These SDKs are constantly evolving, with new ones being
introduced and old ones being deprecated over time.  Meanwhile, these SDKs
leverage industry-standard protocols, such as OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0, as
well as Google-specific extensions to these protocols.

The full extent of the Google Identity platform can make it difficult to get
started and know which SDKs and/or protocols to use.  This guide provides an
overview of how to use Passport to build web applications that use Google
Identity protocols and SDKs.

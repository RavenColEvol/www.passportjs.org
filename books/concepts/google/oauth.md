# OAuth 1.0

The Google Identity Platform previously supported [OAuth 1.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528084908/https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuthForWebApps).
Support for OAuth 1.0 was shut down on April 20, 2015.

Support for using OAuth 1.0 within Passport was provided by
[passport-google-oauth1](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-google-oauth1/).
Due to the fact that Google no longer supports OAuth 1.0, this strategy is no
longer functional.

WebAuthn is a standard which defines how to use [public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
for authentication to web applications.  By using public key credentials,
WebAuthn improves the security of an application by reducing or eliminating the
need for less secure credentials like passwords and OTPs, which require shared
secrets and are easy to phish.

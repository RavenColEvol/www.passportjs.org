OAuth 1.0 is an authorization protocol that enables an application to obtain
access to an API.  This access is granted with the consent of the user whose
information is protected by the API.  Once granted, the application can then use
the API to read, create, and/or modify information that the user has permitted
the application to access.

OAuth 1.0 can be quite complicated for developers to understand and implement,
especially to those not familiar with implementing security-related protocols
and the necessary cryptographic operations.  Fortunately, Passport makes it easy
to integrate OAuth 1.0 without having to know the underlying details of the
protocol.

This guide provides an overview of OAuth 1.0 and analyzes how the protocol
operates.  It details how Passport works when implementing OAuth 1.0-based
authentication and authorization.  This guide will give you a better
understanding of how Passport and OAuth 1.0 work in your application.

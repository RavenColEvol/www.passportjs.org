# OAuth 2.0

Twitter's support for [OAuth 2.0](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0)
reached [general availability](https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-oauth-2-0-general-availability/163555)
in December 2021 (after a [public beta](https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-oauth-2-0-beta/159189)
period starting in September 2021).

Compared to [OAuth 1.0](../oauth/), OAuth 2.0 offers applications finer-grained
control over the scope of access being requested from the user.  Use of OAuth
2.0 is paired with accessing the Twitter API v2, which supports OAuth 2.0 scopes.

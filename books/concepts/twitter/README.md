# Twitter

Twitter was one of the pioneering social networks to allow people to "connect"
their accounts to other websites.  On April 15, 2009, [Log in with Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/guides/log-in-with-twitter)
was introduced.  Also referred to as Sign in with Twitter, the name by which it
was [originally known](https://web.archive.org/web/20090419165334/http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Sign-in-with-Twitter),
this allowed Twitter to be used for [social login](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_login),
and was built on OAuth 1.0, which was already being used for authorizing access
to the Twitter API.

Today, use of Twitter for signing in trails substantially behind larger
platforms such as Google, Facebook, and Apple.  That being said, Twitter remains
a widely used option on many websites.  Additionally, many websites integrate
with Twitter APIs and need users to authorize access, even if they sign in with
another authentication method.

Integration with Twitter is done primarily via the [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api),
which allows developers to access the conversation happening on Twitter.
Other APIs are also offered as part of Twitter's platform, such as the
[Twitter Ads API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-ads-api) for
programmatically managing advertising campaigns.

Passport can be used to let people sign in with Twitter or obtain authorized
access to the Twitter API on behalf of users, and supports both [OAuth 2.0](./oauth2/)
and [OAuth 1.0](./oauth/).
